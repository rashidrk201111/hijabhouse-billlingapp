  # Invoice Payment Tracking Enhancement

  1. Changes to Invoices Table
    - Add `amount_paid` column to track total payments received
    - Add `payment_status` column to track: 'unpaid', 'partial', 'paid', 'overdue'
    - Update existing status to support new workflow

  2. New Table: invoice_payments
    - `id` (uuid, primary key)
    - `invoice_id` (uuid, references invoices)
    - `amount` (numeric) - payment amount received
    - `payment_date` (date) - when payment was received
    - `payment_method_id` (uuid, references payment_methods)
    - `reference_number` (text) - transaction reference
    - `notes` (text) - payment notes
    - `created_by` (uuid, references profiles)
    - `created_at` (timestamptz)

  3. Security
    - Enable RLS on invoice_payments table
    - Add policies for authenticated users

  4. Important Notes
    - Partial payments are tracked separately
    - Invoice status automatically updates based on amount_paid vs total
    - Payment history is maintained for audit trail
